# RL Agent for Taiwanese Driving School Test Simulation

## üöÄ Project Description

This project aims to develop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent capable of autonomously learning to pass various driving test maneuvers within a simulated Taiwanese driving school environment. The goal is for the agent to master tasks such as S-curves (forward and reverse), parallel parking, and garage parking, ultimately achieving or exceeding the average human pass rate.
